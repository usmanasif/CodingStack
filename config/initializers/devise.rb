  # the encrypted password. By default no pepper is used.

  # (then you should set stretches to 10, and copy REST_AUTH_SITE_KEY to pepper)
  config.encryptor = :restful_authentication_sha1

  # Configure which keys are used when authenticating an user. By default is
  # just :email. You can configure it to use [:username, :subdomain], so for

  # parameters are used only when authenticating and not when retrieving from
  # session. If you need permissions, you should implement that in a before filter.

  # he will be able to access your application without confirming. Default is nil.

  # By default, devise detects the role accessed based on the url. So whenever
  # accessing "/users/sign_in", it knows you are accessing an User. This makes
  # routes as "/sign_in" not possible, unless you tell Devise to use the default
  # scope, setting true below.

  # If you want to use other strategies, that are not (yet) supported by Devise,
  # you can configure them inside the config.warden block. The example below
  # allows you to setup OAuth, using http://github.com/roman/warden_oauth
  #
  # config.warden do |manager|
  #   manager.oauth(:twitter) do |twitter|
  #     twitter.consumer_secret = <YOUR CONSUMER SECRET>
  #     twitter.consumer_key  = <YOUR CONSUMER KEY>
  #     twitter.options :site => 'http://twitter.com'
  #   end
  #   manager.default_strategies.unshift :twitter_oauth
  # end

  # Configure default_url_options if you are using dynamic segments in :path_prefix
  # for devise_for.
  # config.default_url_options do
  #   { :locale => I18n.locale }
