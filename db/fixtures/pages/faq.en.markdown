#Frequently Asked Questions#


##What should my questions be about?##


Your questions should be about %site_name%, of course! Make sure your question is:


* to the point, so that others users can answer you the more precisely they can

* clear and concise, to avoid confusion

* relevant


##What kind of questions should I avoid?##

* Try to avoid provocative questions asked in a subjective way

* Post questions, not arguments


For example: Obama is trying to drill oil all over our coasts which will be an ecological disaster, what can we do about it?


Instead: Is drilling oil on our coast really necessary, what are the dangers for the ecology? What can be done about it?


Be a model netizen:

Be honest, helpful, keep a sense of humor and humility (it's ok to be wrong) and if you find somebody to be wrong, explain why in a comment, vote the post down and try to edit the post to improve it.


##How does reputation work?##

The goal of reputation is to create confidence among users, and reward our best netizens. A user who will be very useful to the community will gain reputation points and be granted more editing power. However, don't make gaining reputation an end, just try to be the best netizen possible and reputation points will come to you.


**More precisely, this is how it works:**


If your question is appreciated by other users, they will vote it up and you will gain 10 reputation points. If they don't like your post, they will vote it down and you will lose 2 points. As you gain points, you will be able to do more. Here is a non-exhaustive list of action and points you need execute them:

* 5 points: Leave comments

* 15 points: Vote up

* 15 points: Flag posts as spam, offensive or offtopic

* 100 points: Vote down (costs 1 rep), edit community wiki posts

* 250 points: Vote to close or reopen your questions

* 500 points: Retag questions

* 2000 points: Edit other peopleâ€™s posts

* 3000 points: Vote to close or reopen any questions

* 10000 points: Delete closed questions, access to moderation pages.


Users that reach 10000 points or more have almost the same rights as the site admins. This is because %site_name% is a participative platform and follows the Wikipedia example where users run the site. %site_name% belongs to you.
